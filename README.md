The objective was to program the robot to perform a certain number of project.

Equipment:
-Arduino uno 
-Suport
-2 wheels (use of a custom library )
-A ball in the front for stability 
-Ultrasonic detector UHCSRO4
-Some sort of color sensor (4 at the front)
-Battery


The four different project:
1) Picture name Line in project Line: 
    We just had to follow the line using the color sensors.
    In the middle of the line we had to stop and continue with 2 times less speed,
    at the end of the line we just had to stop.
2) Picture name Square in project Square:
    We had to follow the line whatever the direction of departure,
    at the end of a complete turn and half (1,5 turn) it was required to stop
    and move in the middle of the rectangle.
3) Picture name Circle in project Circle:
    We had to stay inside the two circles,
    after having detected the obstacle (in grey with the ultrasong capterus)
    the robot had to make a turn on itself and start again.
4) Picture name Labyrinth in the project Labyrinth:
    The final objective was to gather everything we had learned during the last 3 projects in order to complete this one.
    The robot had to go through the maze once following the line and find the exit (represented by a box that would be detected by the ulstrasong computer).
    Then we put it back where it started and it has to find the way out as fast as possible.
    For this project the starting point of the robot is not important.
    And the robot must be able to meet the requirements on any kind of maze.
